# SDL-Space-Shooter-v2
My rendition of a space shooter using the sdl2 library and C++. Currently detects basic collision between lasers(shot with the spacebar) and boxes and lets you move around the left half of the screen with the arrow keys. Initially created solo at Google HackAtlanta 2016. This is v2, where the collision detector has been debugged, sometimes deletes objects that didn't truly collide.
